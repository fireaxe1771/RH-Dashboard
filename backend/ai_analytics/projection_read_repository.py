"""Read-side adapter for the AI Analytics Worker projection (Phases 9-10).

When ``settings.AI_ANALYTICS_USE_PROJECTION`` is true, the analytics services
read AI-side fields from the worker's ``ai_invoice_analytics`` projection
collection (in the dashboard-owned Mongo) instead of issuing a per-request
``$in`` query against the operational RecoveryHub_AI Mongo cluster.

This module is the thin adapter between the projection's field names
(Section 9 of the Phase 0 plan) and the field names that
``normalization_core.build_normalized_record`` reads from a raw
``ai_line_items`` document. By mapping projection → ai_record shape, the
existing ``build_normalized_record`` is reused unchanged — the SQL-side
join (business_outcome, cancellation, process_logs) stays identical, and
only the AI-Mongo source is swapped.

Phase 10 additions:
-- ``projection_to_trace_data`` maps the projection to the full field
   shape that ``invoice_trace_service`` needs (including ``line_items``
   with nested ``resources``, ``review_msg``, timestamps,
   ``conversation_id``, ``thread_id_is_billable``). This eliminates the
   ``ai_line_items`` cross-cluster read for the Invoice Trace endpoint.
-- ``get_projection_for_trace`` fetches a single projection by claim_id
   and returns the trace data dict (or ``None`` if no projection).
-- ``aggregate_agent_stats_from_projections`` aggregates per-conversation
   summaries from the projection collection for ``/diagnostics/agents``,
   eliminating the batch cross-cluster read on the conversations
   collection.

Source: ``ai_invoice_analytics`` collection in the dashboard-owned Mongo
(``db_manager.db``, NOT ``db_manager.ai_db``).
Destination: none (read-only).
Architectural constraints:
-- Never reads from RecoveryHub_AI Mongo (the projection is the cache).
-- Returns dicts shaped like raw ``ai_line_items`` documents so
   ``build_normalized_record`` works without modification.
-- Claims with no projection are simply absent from the result dict —
   ``build_normalized_record`` handles ``ai_record=None`` gracefully.
-- ``thread_id`` and ``retry_thread_id`` are not stored in the projection
   (Section 9 does not include them). They are 0% populated in production
   per the Phase 0 audit, so their absence is semantically identical to
   the direct-read path returning ``None`` for them. ``retry_count`` IS
   stored (Section 9.6, 30% populated) and is passed through unchanged.
-- v1 projections (pre-Phase 10) lack ``conversation_summaries``,
   ``resources`` in line items, ``conversation_id``, and
   ``thread_id_is_billable``. The trace adapter returns ``None`` for
   these — the caller falls back to the direct-read path. v2 projections
   carry them (Section 9.12 lazy upgrade).
