"""AI Analytics Worker — claim deduplication / debounce queue (Phase 6).

Coalesces multiple change events for the same claim into a single refresh,
preventing unnecessary repeated rebuilds during a burst of updates to the
same claim. With ~98.6% of claims having 0-1 updates (Phase 0 audit) the
queue is mostly a pass-through, but it protects against the rare burst
scenario and against backfill + change-stream overlap.

Design:
- ``ClaimQueue`` is an in-process (asyncio) unbounded queue. It is NOT
  durable — the reconciliation safety net (Phase 7) covers any events lost
  on a crash between enqueue and refresh.
- ``enqueue(claim_id)`` records the current monotonic time for the claim.
  If the claim is already pending, the timer is **reset** — the claim waits
  another full debounce window. This is the coalescing mechanism: a burst
  of N updates to the same claim within ``debounce_seconds`` results in a
  single ``refresh_claim`` call.
- ``pop_ready()`` removes and returns all claim_ids that have been in the
  queue for at least ``debounce_seconds``.
- ``run_queue_consumer`` is the async loop that drains the queue, calls
  ``refresh_claim`` for each ready claim, and respects ``stop_event`` for
  graceful shutdown. It also yields to the event loop every
  ``max_claims_per_cycle`` claims (Section 1.1.5 starvation guard).

Lifecycle: created by ``run_worker`` (main.py), shared by the change-stream
listener (producer), the reconciliation loop (producer), and the queue
consumer (drainer). Closed when the worker shuts down.

Source: none (in-memory data structure).
Destination: ``ai_invoice_analytics`` and ``ai_analytics_worker_dead_letters``
(via ``refresh_claim`` called by the consumer).
Architectural constraints:
-- Never blocks the FastAPI event loop — all waits are ``await asyncio``.
-- Cancellable via ``stop_event`` — the consumer exits promptly.
-- One bad claim never stops the consumer — dead-lettered (via refresh_claim).

class ClaimQueue:
    """In-process claim deduplication and debounce queue.

    Coalesces multiple change events for the same claim into a single
    refresh. When a claim_id is enqueued, its debounce timer starts (or
    resets if already pending). The claim becomes "ready" after
    ``debounce_seconds`` have elapsed without a new enqueue for the same
    claim.

    The queue is unbounded and in-memory. It is not durable across restarts
    — the reconciliation safety net (Phase 7) covers lost events.

    Lifecycle: created by ``run_worker``, shared by producers (listener,
    reconciliation) and the consumer. ``close()`` is called during shutdown
    to wake the consumer.

    Inputs: ``enqueue(claim_id)`` calls from producers.
    Outputs: ``pop_ready()`` returns claim_ids ready for refresh.
    Dependencies: ``debounce_seconds`` (config), ``asyncio.Event`` for wakeup.
    Error behavior: never raises — ``enqueue`` returns False if closed.
